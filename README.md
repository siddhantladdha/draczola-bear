[![Deploy Zola site to Pages](https://github.com/siddhantladdha/draczola-bear/actions/workflows/zola-minimal.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/siddhantladdha/draczola-bear/actions/workflows/zola-minimal.yml)

🧸 A [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/)-theme based on [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev) now in [Dracula colors](https://draculatheme.com/)

> Free, no-nonsense, super-fast blogging.
> Dracula is a universal dark theme.

## Demo

TODO: Add it.

## Installation

If you already have a Zola site on your machine, you can simply add this theme via

```
git submodule add https://github.com/siddhantladdha/draczola-bearblog themes/draczola-bearblog
```

Then, adjust the `config.toml`.

Alternatively, you can quickly deploy a copy of the theme site to Github pages by forking this repository.
(Note that this method makes it harder to keep up-to-date with theme updates, which might be necessary for newer versions of Zola.)
